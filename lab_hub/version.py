"""The app's version, derived from the repository rather than hand-typed.

    v<MAJOR>.<BUILD>          e.g. v2.025

**MAJOR** is the product arc, the only hand-edited part. It lives in the
`VERSION` file at the project root and changes on a deliberate milestone.

**BUILD** is `git rev-list --count HEAD`, zero-padded to three digits. It is
derived, so it cannot be forgotten — a hand-maintained build number is wrong
the first time someone ships without remembering to bump it, and then silently
wrong forever.

This is the lab-wide scheme, shared with `imprint` and `sonar`, and the Lab
Project Monitor computes the same string from the same two inputs, so the
dashboard and the running app cannot disagree.

A frozen `.app` has no `.git`, so the build is stamped into `_build_info.json`
at package time by `scripts/stamp_version.py` and read back here. Running from
a checkout prefers live git, so an edit shows up on the next launch without
re-stamping. Where there is neither, this says so: `v2.???` rather than a
number invented from the nearest thing to hand. Claiming a version with no
evidence is a lie told in exactly the moment someone is asking.

Qt-free on purpose, like the rest of this package: it is read by `--selftest`
as well as by the window.
