## v2 — current

- [ ] `P1` `feature` `@ai` Health check per launched app — show whether its venv resolves and its entry point exists *before* the launch button is pressed
- [ ] `P1` `bug` `@ai` A launched child that dies immediately currently looks identical to one that started fine; surface the exit code
- [x] `P2` `feature` `@me` Decide whether Lab Hub should start at login (LaunchAgent) or stay manual — decided yes: `lab_hub/login_item.py` installs a LaunchAgent, toggled from the Settings tab, and on login it also starts Backup Control Center and git_autosync if they're not already running.
- [ ] `P2` `testing` `@ai` Extend `--selftest` to launch every registered app, not just a sibling sample
- [x] `P3` `design` `@ai` Apps tab: group by category rather than one flat list, now that there are twelve projects — addressed by splitting into three tabs (Apps / Backup & Sync / Tools) instead of grouping within one tab; the Apps tab itself is back down to 5 items (`PRIMARY_APPS`).
- [x] `P1` `bug` `@ai` Red button quit instead of hiding — and the fix for that re-showed the window in the same breath as closing it. Both shipped, with `tests/test_window_lifecycle.py` as the regression.
- [x] `P2` `infra` `@ai` Config written to `~/Library/Application Support/Lab Hub/`, never inside the bundle
- [x] `P2` `feature` `@ai` **Narrator Library** — a second sub-tab browsing the generated ebook catalogue (`ebook_catalog.csv` from Codex's `outputs/`), with per-row Read/Queue checkboxes persisted to `narrator_library_state.json`, a Narrated-books filter (matched against existing audio files, not tracked separately), and one click to load a book into Convert. `ui/narrator_library.py`, `tests/test_narrator_tab.py`.
- [x] `P1` `bug` `@ai` **Dock icon shown only while a window is open** — done, and
  verified in the packaged app across all four states (login start, app launched from
  the menu bar, window opened, window closed). Three pieces were needed: `LSUIElement`
  in the bundle (LaunchServices pins the type from `Info.plist`, so the runtime switch
  alone is ignored once packaged), the policy switch in `ui/dock.py`, and — the piece
  that was missing — `dock.activate()`, because promoting out of `Accessory` gives a
  Dock icon but does not make the app frontmost, so the window was created and left
  sitting behind everything. That looked like "no window", which is why this was
  reverted once as impossible. The real cause of that wrong turn was the instrument:
  `lsappinfo` reports the type declared in `Info.plist`, not the live policy.
  `--selftest` now prints the true reading via `dock.current_policy()` — use that,
  never `lsappinfo`. `tests/test_window_lifecycle.py`.
- [x] `P1` `bug` `@ai` **Apps tab pointed at a renamed project** — the tile called
  `create_and_publish` no longer resolved (renamed to `imprint`), but
  `Create & Publish.app` was still installed, so the card read *Installed* and
  silently launched a stale build. Worse than a dead tile.
- [x] `P2` `design` `@ai` **Umbrella apps only — agents are not separately launchable.**
  Tunnel and Bug Spray live inside Sentinel Fork (`sentinel_fork/agents/`), the video
  pipeline inside Imprint, macro and Playmaker inside SONAR. Lab Hub lists the three
  umbrella apps and nothing below them, in the Apps tab and the menu bar alike. The
  nested-companion rows tried in between are gone: they still offered a second door to
  a feature that belongs to its parent app. Note `/Applications/VPN Agent.app` is an
  **orphaned bundle** — its source moved to `sentinel_fork/agents/vpn_agent`, so the
  installed copy is built from a path that no longer exists. Not deleted: VPN Agent is
  essential to Sentinel and is being worked on elsewhere. `tests/test_tab_groups.py`,
  `tests/test_tray.py`.
- [x] `P3` `design` `@ai` Menu bar lists **top-level apps only** — companions were
  appearing there as peers, making a six-item menu nine items long. `MENU_BAR_APPS`,
  `tests/test_tray.py`.
- [x] `P3` `bug` `@ai` Tab read "Backup_Sync" — Qt treats `&` in a tab label as a
  mnemonic marker. Renamed to "Backup and Sync", with a test forbidding `&` in labels.


## v3 — later

- [ ] `P2` `feature` `@ai` Read each project's `TODO.md` and show an open-item count next to its launch button
- [ ] `P2` `feature` `@me` Decide whether Ebook Converter deserves a tile — its job is
  already the embedded Convert Files tab, so a launch button would be a second door to
  the same thing. Left off for now.
- [ ] `P3` `infra` `@ai` Prune stale bundles: `Sentinel AI.app` (project archived) and
  `Create & Publish.app` (renamed to Imprint) are both still in `/Applications`.
- [ ] `P3` `feature` `@ai` Global search across every project's docs from the hub
- [ ] `P3` `feature` `@ai` Per-app last-launched timestamp and crash count

## Out of scope, deliberately

Lab Hub does not replace the projects it launches. Each keeps its own repo, README, venv and build script. Changing what Sentinel AI does still means changing Sentinel AI.
